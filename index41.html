<h2>Image file type</h2>

<h3>What inspired me to choose Wukong</h3>
<p>I overall really like the different mythologies that the creatures that exist in them, have their own long and vast story. Wukong is of no exception due to his sheer influence, reputation and the grand arsenal of tales that he can share.</p>
