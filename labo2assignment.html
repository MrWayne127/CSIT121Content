<h1>What I learned thus far</h1> 
<ul>1.</ul>
<main>
    <p>What I have learned so far in the class, is to be able and figure out the properties and the material behind the new application. 
        There is also the wonder about touching upon the different setps of formation, text and how to illustrate it within the context.
    </p>

<h2>Another Thing I learned</h2>
<ul>2.</ul>
<p>Im learning more and more about what I have to do in order to keep up with how this other brand of stuff, especially with HTML being as complex as it was.
    This application is so much more than I anticipated when I first learned about it however, with more repitition and improvement as it goes by it becomes easier to follow and articulate. 
</p>
<h3>The Many Things in Insight</h3>
<ul>3.</ul>
<p>It is a whole bunch of different methods and overall pacing with both the new software for my computer, the different varieties of actions that unfold and the rapid changes in each assignment. I do agree on the fact that it all can be fun and very educational, as long as you don't get too frustrated at the problems and overall learning curve. 
    I do have to thank my teacher for being as patient as they are in order to fundamentally learn how the process works for my future classes.

<articile> From how and where I was able to learn before this Class</articile>
<ol>My Prior Experience</ol>
<p>Before I came to CCBC, I used to be back within University of Baltimore most of my classes were about technology and how to really incorporate them into my daily life. I even used to go to a different University in order to learn about binary coding and so forth, which was my very first experience doing so at the time.</p>
